### Project Challenge: Simple Employee Manager

#### Project Idea:
Create a simple application to manage employees where users can add new employees, assign permissions, display their data, and modify their salaries, permissions, and job descriptions.

#### Requirements:
1. *Variables and Constants:*
   - Use variables and constants to store employee data and identifiers.

2. *Declaring Variables with var:*
   - Use var to declare variables that might change, such as the list of employees.

3. *Declaring Constants with const:*
   - Use const to declare constants, such as instruction messages.

4. *Type Inference and Type Annotation:*
   - Practice using type inference and type annotations for better code clarity.

5. *Printing to the Console:*
   - Use the print() function to display messages and employee data in the console.

6. *Data Types:*
   - Utilize different data types like int, double, bool, and String to manage employee attributes.

7. *Comments in Dart:*
   - Write single-line and multi-line comments to document your code.

8. *Operators:*
   - Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators where appropriate, such as in salary calculations and permission checks.

9. *Collections:*
   - Use Lists, Sets, and Maps to store and manage employee data.

10. *User Input in Dart:*
    - Implement functions to accept user input for employee details.

11. *Control Flow:*
    - Use control flow statements like if-else and switch to handle different scenarios in your application.

12. *Functions:*
    - Define functions to add, update, and display employee data.

13. *Clean Code:*
    - Ensure your code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.

14. *Project Structure:*
    - Divide your project into functions and modules to keep it organized and modular.

15. *User-Friendly Output:*
    - Ensure the console output is well-formatted and clear for the user to understand.

#### Example Features to Implement:
1. *Add a New Employee:*
   - Collect details such as name, salary, permissions, and job description.
   - Store these details in a list or map.

2. *Assign Permissions:*
   - Allow modification of employee permissions and validate input.

3. *Display Employee Data:*
